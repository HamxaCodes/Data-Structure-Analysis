\lhead{Chapter 1. \emph{Problem Statement}} 
The main objectives of this Complex Engineering Problem are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item To develop programs that store and manage the given data by using four different data structures, that are:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Hash Table (Quadratic Probing)
			\item Array
			\item Linked List
			\item Binary Tree
		\end{enumerate}
	\item Implement the following operations on the given data:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Insert all of the given data in a data structure.
			\item Print data of data structure in sorted order (traverse in sorted order) (numerically or alphabetically).
			\item Find records.
			\item Delete half of the data from the data structure.			
		\end{enumerate}
	\item To measure execution time and memory consumption for each operation.
	\item To compare operations on different data structures depending on their execution time and memory consumption and conclude which data structure is the best for each operation.
\end{itemize}
